## Project Setup
1. Clone repo
2. Download the [ASI Camera SDK](https://www.zwoastro.com/software/)
3. Copy the Android SDK files into the `app/libs` dir, so you end up with something like:
   ```
   app/libs/zwocamera.jar
   app/libs/arm64-v8a/libASICamera2.so
   app/libs/arm64-v8a/libzwo_camera.so
   ... etc
   ```
4. ...
5. Profit!
